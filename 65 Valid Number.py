"""
A valid number can be split up into these components (in order):

1). A decimal number or an integer.
(Optional) An 'e' or 'E', followed by an integer.
A decimal number can be split up into these components (in order):

(Optional) A sign character (either '+' or '-').
One of the following formats:
One or more digits, followed by a dot '.'.
One or more digits, followed by a dot '.', followed by one or more digits.
A dot '.', followed by one or more digits.

2) An integer can be split up into these components (in order):

(Optional) A sign character (either '+' or '-').
One or more digits.
For example, all the following are valid numbers: ["2", "0089", "-0.1", "+3.14", "4.", "-.9", "2e10", "-90E3", "3e+7",
"+6e-1", "53.5e93", "-123.456e789"], while the following are not valid numbers:
["abc", "1a", "1e", "e3", "99e2.5", "--6", "-+3", "95a54e53"].

Given a string s, return true if s is a valid number.
